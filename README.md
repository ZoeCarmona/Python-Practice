# Python Arrays & Lists Practice

## Overview
This repository is focused on practicing arrays (lists) in Python.
Lists are one of the most important data structures in Python and are widely used to store, access, and manipulate collections of data.

## Key Characteristics
- Ordered
- Mutable (can be modified in-place)
- Indexed starting from 0
- Can store different data types

## Practice Exercises
Some of the exercises implemented or planned in this repository include:
- Reverse an array in-place
- Find the minimum and maximum value
- Swap the first and last elements
- Rotate an array
- Move specific elements (e.g. zeros) to the end
- Sum all elements in a list
- Check if an array is a palindrome

## Goal
The goal of this repository is to:
- Understand how Python lists work
- Practice common array algorithms
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Prepare for coding interviews and technical challenges

## How to Run
Make sure you are inside the project directory and run:
```bash
python filename.py
