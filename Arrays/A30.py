# Merge Sorted Array (In-place)

# Pattern: Two pointers from the end

# Problem
# You’re given nums1 with enough extra space at the end to hold nums2.
# Merge nums2 into nums1 in sorted order.

# Input:
# nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
# nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3
# Output:
# [1,2,2,3,5,6]

def merge(nums1, m, nums2, n):
    pass
